# Reverse Logistics Program Case Study

## Problem
Reverse logistics operations supporting large-scale infrastructure environments often face
cycle time variability, fragmented workflows, and limited visibility into material flow performance.

This case study outlines how I approached a reverse logistics program to improve cycle time,
operational consistency, and stakeholder visibility.

## Scope
- Reverse logistics and returns processing
- Transportation and warehouse coordination
- Multi-regional operations
- Cross-functional stakeholders (Operations, Transportation, Finance, Software)

## Approach
1. Defined success metrics (cycle time, SLA adherence, defect rate)
2. Standardized reverse logistics workflows using lean principles
3. Built dashboards to monitor performance and surface exceptions
4. Established corrective action plans with regional partners
5. Partnered with software teams on tooling requirements

## Key Metrics (Example)
- Cycle time variability: ↓ ~25%
- SLA adherence: Improved to >95%
- Defect rate: Reduced significantly through root cause analysis

## Risks & Mitigations
- Data accuracy → dashboard validation checks
- Stakeholder alignment → recurring program reviews
- Volume spikes → documented escalation paths

## Outcome
Delivered a more predictable, scalable reverse logistics operation with improved visibility,
reduced variability, and stronger cross-functional execution.
